## Fake Email Handler

### Overview

Fake Email Handler is a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) that allows users to generate and manage temporary email addresses for testing and development purposes. This project provides a simulated environment where users can create fake email addresses, receive emails sent to those addresses, and view received emails through a web interface.

### Features

- **Generate Fake Email Address**: Automatically generate random email addresses (e.g., `random123@yourdomain.com`) for temporary use.
- **Receive Emails**: Capture and store emails sent to any generated fake email address.
- **View Received Emails**: View detailed information about received emails, including sender, subject, and message content.
- **Simple and Intuitive Interface**: User-friendly web interface for managing fake email addresses and viewing received emails.
- **Backend Storage**: Utilizes MongoDB for storing email addresses and their associated received emails.

### Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Deployment**: Local development environment
